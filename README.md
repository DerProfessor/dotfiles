# Professor's dotfiles
Here I share my dotfiles.

## Install
To install dotfiles run the following commands:
```zsh
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/DerProfessor/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./init.sh
```

## Develop
For easy developing my shell config I use a devcontainer.
Just clone the repository anywhere and launch VSCode inside it.
VSCode should automatically prompt to reopen the folder in a devcontainer.

For initializing the dotfiles the `init` VSCode task can be called.
